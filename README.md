# Baram: Advanced System Cooling Management Tool

## Overview

Baram is a pioneering cooling management tool designed for enthusiasts repurposing Nvidia data center GPUs in ATX-like cases, and now extending its functionality to comprehensive system fan control. By optimizing the cooling for both the high-performance GPUs and the overall system, Baram aims to enhance thermal performance, extend component longevity, and reduce noise. Tailored for Linux systems, Baram offers a CLI-based interface that appeals to both seasoned enthusiasts and users new to custom thermal management.

## Mission

Our mission with Baram is to facilitate a new beginning for used data center GPUs by providing a sophisticated, yet accessible, cooling management tool. Baram extends its utility beyond the GPU, offering system-wide fan control to harmonize cooling efficiency and acoustic performance across the entire system.

## Key Features

### Stage 1: Profile Management and Dynamic Temperature Logic

- **Profile Management**: Create, save, and switch between cooling profiles for different use cases or system states.
- **Dynamic Temperature Monitoring**: Implement adaptive fan control based on real-time GPU and system temperatures.

### Stage 2: Comprehensive Fan Identification and Logic Expansion

- **System-Wide Fan Identification**: Easily identify and configure GPU, CPU, and chassis fans, facilitating a unified cooling strategy.
- **Enhanced Temperature Logic**: Further refine temperature monitoring and fan control algorithms, incorporating feedback and comprehensive system considerations.

### Stage 3: Airflow Optimization and Noise Management

- **Airflow Optimization Profiles**: Develop profiles that optimize the balance between intake and exhaust, improving cooling efficiency and reducing noise.
- **Noise Optimization Mode**: Introduce a specific mode aimed at minimizing operational noise while maintaining effective cooling, ideal for work or low-noise environments.

### Stage 4: Data Visualization and Real-time Monitoring

- **Historical Data Graphing**: Generate graphs from historical log data to visualize the cooling performance and system temperatures over time.
- **Live Graphing**: Implement real-time graphing of temperature and fan speeds during stress tests or normal operations, providing immediate visual feedback.
